Modern CSS has evolved significantly, providing powerful tools for creating complex layouts. Let's explore some of the most effective techniques.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that has revolutionized web layouts. Here are some key features:

- Easy alignment of items both horizontally and vertically
- Flexible track sizing with fr units
- Grid template areas for named grid sections
- Auto-placement algorithms

## Flexbox

While Grid handles 2D layouts, Flexbox excels at 1D layouts:

- Perfect for navigation bars
- Card layouts
- Centering content
- Distributing space between items

## Container Queries

The newest addition to CSS layout tools:

- Style elements based on their container's size
- Create truly reusable components
- More granular control than media queries

These modern techniques make it easier than ever to create responsive, maintainable layouts.
