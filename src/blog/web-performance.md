3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## Image Optimization

Images often have the biggest impact on performance:

- Implement responsive images
- Lazy loading
- Proper sizing and compression

## JavaScript Performance

Keep your JavaScript lean and efficient:

- Efficient event handlers

Remember: Performance isn't a one-time task but an ongoing process of optimization.
